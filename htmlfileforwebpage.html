        A stack is a logical concept that consists of a set of similar elements. The term is often used in programming and
        memory organization in computers.
        <br>
        Programming stacks are based on the principle of last in first out (LIFO), a commonly used type of data abstract that
        consists of two major operations, push and pop. The push operation adds an element to the bottom of stack while the pop
        operation removes an element from the top position.
        <br>
        In the case of bounded capacity stacks, trying to add an element to an already full stack causes a stack overflow
        exception. Similarly, a condition where a pop operation tries to remove an element from an already empty stack is known
        as underflow.
        <br>
        A stack is considered to be a restricted data structure as only a limited number of operations are allowed. Besides the
        push and pop operations, certain implementations may allow for advanced operations such as:
        <br>
        Peek — View the topmost item in the stack.
        <br>
        Duplicate — Copy the top item’s value into a variable and push it back into the stack.
        <br>
        Swap — Swap the two topmost items in the stack.
        <br>
        Rotate — Move the topmost elements in the stack as specified by a number or move in a rotating fashion.
    </p>
